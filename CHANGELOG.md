# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Each release is deployed to
[seriesoftub.es](https://seriesoftub.es).

## [Unreleased]

- Barcelona joins the map with Catnip-IX, local transit and peering.
- More exchanges now include FRIES-IX, Paella-NIX, KleyWrecks,
  LO-NAPS, JINXED-IX and IX Strayla, plus BB-Kicks in Tokyo.
  FRIES-IX 10G and 100G ports and LAG members are free.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-10-24

- Router ports are finite. Every transit, IX, PNI and cache port, every wave
  and every fibre channel takes a router port; 10G ports ride a breakout,
  four to a port. The Infra tab shows how many are left, and plugging in more
  than you have is refused.
- More routers: up to six per POP, and six new models to swap in from the
  Infra tab: Mikrowtik CCR-ish, Sonic the Whitebox 32 (cheap, crashes more),
  Arrrhipster 7280R-ish and 7800R-ish (lots of ports, deep buffers, boots in
  minutes), Disco 8K-ish (licence keys for everything) and Knockia 7750-ish.
  A swap that would not fit what is already plugged in is refused.
- New cities: Milan, Rome, Palermo, Lisbon and Athens in Europe; Atlanta,
  Denver, Phoenix, Boston, Houston and Salt Lake City in the US. New cables
  land with them (Lisbon to Brazil, Africa and the US Southeast; Genoa to
  Sicily and Athens; Palermo to Marseille and Alexandria; Athens to Istanbul;
  Boston to Dublin), along with local networks to peer with.
- Rival exchanges: 25 big metros now have a second (sometimes third) IX.
  Challengers are cheaper and share many members with the incumbent, but not
  all of them. Each IX is its own port, LAG and route server.
- The long tail: 60 small, odd networks with a sliver of traffic each, spread
  over random exchanges. "Request all willing peers" signs them up in one go,
  and they fold into one row in the network lists.
- Europe's peering market is competitive: IX ports there cost 20% less, and
  price wars between rival exchanges cut your port bill further. DE-KICKS
  responds with a webinar.
- Voda-Phony has ended settlement-free peering. It now peers only over a paid
  PNI, through its interconnection partner.
- New US eyeballs Spectre-um Cable and Very-Zone (paid peering only).
- Pausing now freezes the map too: packet dots, waves and clouds stop
  moving until you press play again (#11).
- Ports in both buildings: with a second site, any transit port, PNI or IX
  port can now be set to "Both". That splits it into a LAG with members in
  each building (adding a member if needed), so a dark building only takes
  out half the port instead of all of it (#8).
- The top bar no longer wraps onto a second row and covers the side panels
  on laptop-sized screens.
- Routers make sense now: the Chonk 800 takes 800G waves and ports (a new
  800G wave sits between 400G and 1.6T), and only the Absolute Unit has 1.6T
  ports and takes 6.4T waves, handed off as 4×1.6T. Existing waves keep
  their size.
- London–Amsterdam is everywhere: three more cheap North Sea cables, and dark
  fiber you can lease on them (and on the Channel), since you can't dig under
  the sea.
- Your own IX can grow (#10): upgrade its fabric from 400G to 1.6T, 6.4T and
  25.6T. Bigger fabrics carry more and have room for more members.
- Wave prices follow real markets: Europe is cheap, North America average,
  Asia and South America pricier, and anything into Africa several times the
  price. Every route has its own going rate, and new leases get about 8%
  cheaper each year. The link planner tells you how a route compares.
- Cairo–Dubai over the Red Sea, plus I-ME-WE-Us to Fujairah and Mumbai.
- The Gulf: Jeddah, Riyadh and Doha. Saudi POPs need a local telecom licence,
  gigaprojects want enormous demo networks, and now and then the neighbours
  fall out and every link between Qatar and Saudi Arabia or the UAE goes dark
  for months. Qatar is on the map as a peninsula now, too.
- Tablets in landscape: slimmer side panels, bigger touch targets, and the
  left panel tucks away while a city is open (tap "Goals & NOC" to bring it
  back).

## [1.9.0] — 2026-10-23

- RouteScript: program your Auto-TE controller from the NOC tab with a tiny
  rule language: `spill at 80%`, `prefer pni for goggle`, `avoid transit for
  netchill`, `cap transit cogentle at 20 gbps`, `drain paris`, `avoid link
  fra-ams` and `blackhole ddos`. Check runs a dry run against live traffic
  and shows what would change; Deploy makes it real. Typos get a "did you
  mean". Two new badges: Script Kiddie and Fat Finger.
- Zoom in twice as far as before, handy for crowded spots like the UAE,
  Singapore or Central Europe.
- Half speed: a new ½× button, or press 0.
- NOC dashboard: a legend explains the colours in "How it arrives", the
  network table sorts by any column (traffic, transit cost, loss, name), and a
  new "Who your transit carries" list shows the networks you pay transit to
  reach, with the cheapest way to move each one to peering (#7).
- The Transit tab shows the top destinations on each transit port, with the
  same hint, so you can see who to peer with in that city (#7).
- A full code review, and about 40 fixes from it:
  - Saves and imported files are checked and repaired before use, so a
    damaged or hand-edited save can no longer break the game or inject
    anything into the page.
  - Loophole fixes: flipping crypto loans for profit, free repairs of
    geopolitical cable cuts, re-rolling DE-KICKS quotes, walking out of a
    failing event, and selling the same trench twice.
  - The Red Sea scenario really cuts the Red Sea now, the weekly challenge
    gives everyone the same world, and its "pricey" and "poor" twists work.
  - China Telecomet and China Unicorn no longer act like Tier 1s.
  - Metro ring cuts now alert you, overlapping site outages no longer cancel
    each other, and alien waves work on unlit fiber.
  - Routing is several times faster on big networks.
  - The map fills wide screens at any zoom, pinch zoom goes as far as the
    mouse wheel, and touch scrolling and cancelled touches behave.
  - Starting a scenario from a running game asks first, and Space no longer
    pauses when you meant to press a button.
- Settings for animations and sound, in the menu and on the help screen.
  Animations can follow your device's reduce-motion setting (the default),
  or be forced on or off. Off freezes the map: no moving packets, pulses or
  floating text.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-10-23

- Traceroute and looking glass: tap 🔍 Traceroute on any of your cities, or
  open it from the NOC tab. See the exact path to any network or POP, hop by
  hop, with latency, the exit it leaves through and the AS path, plus why
  that exit won.
- Share card: an image of your network with a mini map, your stats and your
  rarest badges, ready to post. Find it in the menu, after winning and after
  a scenario.
- Scenarios: six hand-built challenges with a goal and a deadline (Only
  Spätzle-IX, Red Sea Crisis, The Cogentle Spat, Carnaval, Mind the Gap and
  Anchors Away), plus a weekly challenge where everyone gets the same world,
  the same start city and the same two twists for a week.
- Sandbox mode: a billion dollars, every unlock and nothing ever breaks.
  No badges, though.
- Conference season: NANOG-ish, RIPE-ish, DENOG-ish, APRICOT-ish and more
  come round every year. Register in the Deals tab and selective networks in
  that region need half the usual traffic to peer with you for 45 days.
- A guided first game for new players, step by step, with a skip button.
- Kyiv, with Varenyky-IX and KyivStar-ish. Blackouts are frequent, so bring
  a generator. Nobody sells capacity between Kyiv and Moscow.
- 7 more badges for scenarios, the weekly challenge and conferences.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-10-23

- Auto-TE: from customer level 3 you can install a traffic-engineering
  controller in the NOC tab. When the shortest path is full, the overflow
  spills onto up to two alternate paths with free capacity instead of being
  dropped. Without it, traffic still reroutes around failures, but a full
  link stays full, just like a real IGP.
- 16 more badges, mostly rare, epic and legendary: Traffic Whisperer, Same
  Street, Anchors Aweigh, Samba Peering, DE-KICKS Bingo, Ring of Fire, Iron
  Curtain Call, Island Hopper, Through the Wall, Darwin Award, Unbreakable,
  Gigawatt Landlord, Blitz, Hundred Terabits and a few more, one of them
  secret. That makes 46.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-10-23

- South America is on the map properly: Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos
  Aires, Santiago, Lima, Bogotá and Panama City, with new cables including a
  ring round Cape Horn, a direct São Paulo–New York cable and the first
  cable from Chile to Sydney. Nothing crosses the Darién Gap by land, transit
  is pricier because so much traffic hairpins through Miami, and fiber over
  the Andes costs double and breaks often. IX.brrr is run by a nonprofit
  with cheap public prices, and small Brazilian provedores now buy transit
  from you.
- More India: Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, with east-coast cables
  to Singapore and a lot of road widening.
- Taiwan: Taipei, with cables to Tokyo, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Seattle and
  Shanghai, and ships that keep dragging their anchors over them.
- The UAE: Abu Dhabi and Fujairah join Dubai. Only the licensed duopoly may
  run fiber inside the country, so there is no dark fiber, waves cost 3×, and
  POPs need a free-zone license. Most cables land in Fujairah.
- Cape Town, with Atlantic cables up the west coast of Africa and load
  shedding: bring a generator.
- New local networks: Clarovision, Vivo-ish, Mercado Livre-ly, Jio-graphy,
  Airtel-tale, Chunghwa Tele-calm and do-ish.
- Metro diversity: add a second data center in any POP's metro from the
  Infra tab, joined by your own metro ring. A power cut, cleaner or A/C
  failure then only takes out half the city. You choose which site each
  transit, PNI and IX port plugs into, and metro ring cuts can cut site B
  off. Some hyperscaler and AI customers now insist on two sites.
- More Asia-Pacific: Melbourne, Brisbane, Darwin, Osaka, Kuala Lumpur,
  Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Karachi, Dhaka and Colombo, with cables to match.
  Vietnam's cables break a lot, and Darwin has crocodiles.
- Central and Eastern Europe: Warsaw, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest,
  Tallinn and Istanbul. Baltic cables meet a lot of anchors.
- The giants: at customer levels 3 and 4, hyperscalers and AI clouds bring
  deals only they would ask for. Terabit AI WANs between gigawatt campuses,
  training runs spread over three or four sites, week-long dataset ingests,
  and hundreds of fiber pairs in a trench you dug yourself. Their campuses,
  from Star-Gait Abilene to the Johor-ish Overflow, show up in each city's
  "Who's here".
- Dark fiber pairs you lease out now earn even before you light your own
  channels on that fiber.
- More local networks: KD-DIY, Opt-Out-Us, Mostly-True Move, Viet-tell,
  PTC-hell, Telekom Ma-lazy-sia, Türk Tele-komik, Digi-tally Cheap and
  UPC-You-Later.
- Badges: 30 achievements from common to legendary, shown under your goals.
  Some take luck (Shark Bait), some take years (Five Nines, Speedrun), and a
  couple are secret. Badges from earlier games stay on this device in a hall
  of fame.
- Five new goals between Tier 2 and Tier 1: light your own dark fiber, be in
  two buildings at once, five continents, sign a giant, and serve 10 Tbps.
- Tap your network's name in the top left for a menu to export or import a
  save, or start a new network.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-10-23

- Several transits in the same city now share the load instead of filling one
  after the other. The same goes for any exits that are equally close: traffic
  is spread by free capacity, and local exits still win over far ones (#4).
- Export your save to a file and import it on another device, from the help
  screen or the title screen (#5).
- Full transit ports, IX ports, PNIs, caches and routers are now easy to spot.
  They get red badges on the map (T, P, C, R), the IX hexagon blinks red when
  its port is full, and the NOC lists everything running hot with a hint on
  what to do (#6).
- Some routers take forever to boot. The Infra tab shows each chassis's boot
  time and its forwarding chip, including the Junipurr PacketOinker™ in the
  Chonk 800 and two of them in the Absolute Unit. On a slow booter, crashes
  last a few days longer, a rush repair still needs a day of booting, and
  swapping the only router takes three days. Bigger chassis are slow more
  often. A second router hides all of it.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-10-23

- Big peers have moods now. In some cities, large selective networks refuse
  new peering for a few months, or only take PNIs there, each with a reason
  ("the peering coordinator is on sabbatical", "a new VP wants to monetise
  interconnection"). Now and then they also tear down a session you already
  had, and traffic falls back to your next best path. Try another city or a
  PNI, and ask again later.
- Remote peering is still on offer, but it is now a last resort. Ports come
  through a reseller at 1.5× the price and only 80% of the port is really
  yours. Goggle, Faceplant, Comecast and several other selective networks
  refuse remote members outright. The route server still gets you every open
  network, and building a real POP removes all of this.
- DE-KICKS Group (Frankfurt, Madrid, Marseille, Dubai, Mumbai and New York)
  really hates open pricing. There is no price list, only a personalised
  quote that grows with how big you look. Haggling can get you a discount,
  raise the price "after consulting with management", or stall for a week
  behind an NDA. Prices are "harmonised" upwards once a year. Add-ons like
  Route Server Gold and Premium Port LEDs appear on your invoice until you opt
  out, which takes two clicks. Trying to leave gets you a retention discount
  that ends with a loyalty fee.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-10-23

- Event networks: festivals, trade fairs and big games book a fat temporary
  pipe in a city weeks ahead. Nothing is paid up front; deliver the bandwidth
  for the whole event and you get the full fee, fall short and the organisers
  pay less, fail badly and you pay them.
- SD-WAN for chains: kebab empires, coffee franchises and furniture giants
  want every shop wired back to their head office. Each site needs a path to
  the hub, and one dead spoke takes the whole contract down until it is fixed.
- Wholesale waves: once you light your own dark fiber, other carriers ask to
  rent spare spectrum on it as alien waves. Every slot you sell is one fewer
  channel for you.
- Dark fiber pair leases: fiber you built yourself can be leased out pair by
  pair to others for steady monthly money.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-10-23

- A bank: tap your cash to open it. Lenders (Goldman Sacks, Deutsche Bankrupt,
  Spätzle-Sparkasse, the Ministry of Tubes, Crypto Bros Capital, Venture
  Vultures, the Loan Shark and more) make offers with odd conditions. Offers
  come faster when you are in the red, so a bad hour no longer has to end in
  bankruptcy. Credit ratings, penalties for broken conditions, early repayment.
- Your game now saves every few seconds and whenever you leave the page, and a
  reload drops you straight back into your network.
- Release announcements: a "What's new" card after an update, and a banner with
  a one-click reload when a new version comes out while you are playing.
- Start a new network any time from the help screen.
